Tilix 1.8.3 is available, I've been deferring putting one out as I haven't been that busy working on new features however enough bug fixes have been done to warrant a new release. The following changes have been made in this version:

* Added the ability to customize the badge font and size
* Fixed an issue with loading URLs with a hash character
* Fixed an issue where tilix could get stuck in mazimized mode when a background terminal closes behind the scenes
* Added an indicator on the tab to show when new output is detected, only works with VTE alternate-screen patch
* Can now use Tab key when customizing shortcuts
* Re-worked notifications so each terminal has it's own notification rather then one global one for tilix
* Updated to use GtkD 3.8.3
* Added experimental support for process monitoring where the currently running process can be used in the terminal title. Requires enabling a setting in Dconf prefs, may cause segfaults
* Various other bug fixes
